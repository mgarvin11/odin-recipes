        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> You make baked spaghetti almost the same way you would make lasagna. It's a layered, baked casserole with a tomato-based meat sauce, mozzarella, ricotta, and Parmesan cheeses, and pasta.

            The main differences are that you use thin spaghetti noodles instead of wide lasagna pasta, and you toss in a couple of beaten eggs with the cooked noodles.
            
            The eggs help bind the noodles in place so you can easily cut and serve even rectangles without them falling apart.
            
            It's the perfect thing to serve the hungry family visiting for spring break, who somehow manages to eat their weight every day, and get into all kinds of crazy antics.</p>
